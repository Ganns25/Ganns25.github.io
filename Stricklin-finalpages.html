    <h2>Amature Photography</h2>
    <p>I have always enjoyed traveling and taking photos. I have countless photos, unfortunately I do not have them all uploaded to this pc. So the following are just random pictures I selected. If anyone has in tips on catching a good shot, please share with me. Or if you have some pictures you have taken and would like to share, I would love to see them.
